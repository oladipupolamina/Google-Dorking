# Google Dorking — Overview & Responsible Usage

> A short guide explaining what *Google dorking* (advanced search) is, why people use it, and how to approach it ethically and legally.

## What is Google Dorking?
Google dorking refers to the practice of using advanced search operators and carefully crafted queries to find specific content on the web. Researchers, journalists, defenders, and hobbyist OSINT practitioners use advanced search techniques to locate publicly-available information more efficiently.

## Purpose & Typical (Non-actionable) Use Cases
- Security research and responsible disclosure of publicly exposed assets.
- OSINT for journalism, academic research, and background information that is intentionally public.
- Finding publicly-indexed documentation, PDFs, or resources that organizations have deliberately published.
- Assessing an organization’s public attack surface for defensive hardening (performed with permission).

## Important legal and ethical rules
- Only search for content you have explicit permission to access or that is intentionally public.
- Do not attempt to access private systems, bypass authentication, exploit vulnerabilities, or gather private personal data.
- If you discover sensitive information accidentally, follow responsible disclosure practices: do not share the data publicly and report it to the owner securely.
- Laws differ by country — always confirm the legal rules that apply where you operate.

## Safe learning & testing practices
1. Use intentionally prepared test environments (lab sites or your own servers) to learn techniques.  
2. Use public OSINT challenges, CTFs, or learning platforms that provide safe targets.  
3. Practice disclosure etiquette: when you find an issue on someone else’s property, report it privately and responsibly.

## Resources for learning (general, non-actionable)
- Official documentation or guides about web indexing and search operator syntax.
- OSINT introductory courses and legal/ethical training.
- Capture-the-Flag (CTF) platforms and dedicated practice labs for web reconnaissance.
- Books and research papers on web security that emphasize defensive practices.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute improvements to this README, please:
- Keep examples non-actionable or replace them with safe lab examples.
- Add links to vetted, legal resources or training platforms.
- Use clear wording that emphasizes consent and legality.
