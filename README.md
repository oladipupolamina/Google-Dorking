# Google Dorking on Tesla.Inc (Educational reason)

> A short guide explaining some basic attempts in performing  *Google dorking* (advanced search) on Tesla.Inc

## What is Google Dorking?
Google dorking refers to the practice of using advanced search operators and carefully crafted queries to find specific content on the web. Researchers, journalists, defenders, and hobbyist OSINT practitioners use advanced search techniques to locate publicly-available information more efficiently.

## About Tesla.Inc
Tesla is an American electric vehicle and clean-energy company founded in 2003. The faces most people know are Elon Musk, though he wasn’t a founder from day one, he later became the major driver of the company’s crazy ambitions. The true original founders include Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning. A few other early key players joined shortly after, like JB Straubel and Ian Wright.

## Purpose of Google Dorking
- Security research and responsible disclosure of publicly exposed assets.
- OSINT for journalism, academic research, and background information that is intentionally public.
- Finding publicly-indexed documentation, PDFs, or resources that organizations have deliberately published.
- Assessing an organization’s public attack surface for defensive hardening (performed with permission).

## Important legal and ethical rules
- Only search for content you have explicit permission to access or that is intentionally public.
- Do not attempt to access private systems, bypass authentication, exploit vulnerabilities, or gather private personal data.
- If you discover sensitive information accidentally, follow responsible disclosure practices: do not share the data publicly and report it to the owner securely.
- Laws differ by country — always confirm the legal rules that apply where you operate.
